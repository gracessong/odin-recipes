        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Feeling down? A little overwhelmed about your parents who, against your petition, devoured random food in an empty restaurant without waiting for the server or paying and turned into pigs? Have a bite of this rice ball and all your despair will disappear.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A bowl of cooked Japanese rice, fluffy but not too fluffy.</li>
            <li>A filling of your choice - traditional choice would be <em>umeboshi</em>, or pickled plum</em></li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly season the rice with salt.</li>
            <li>Grab a chunk of the rice and form it into a triangle with a divot for the filling.</li>
            <li>Place the filling in the divot. Cover it with the rice and mold it into a triangular shape.</li>
            <li>Voila! (FYI, it works better as a mood-lifter if you're as hot as Haku.)</li>
        </ol>
