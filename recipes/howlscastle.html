        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>Bacon. Thick, thin, maple-syrup-infused, smoked - whatever you want.</li>
            <li>Eggs. The rounder the better.</li>

            <li>Pour a generous amount of oil in the pan and bring it up to high heat.</li>
            <li>Bacon or egg, which goes in first? Well, clearly Howl chose the bacon first and I think he's very much correct. In whichever order you please, carefully place your ingredients in the pan.</li>
